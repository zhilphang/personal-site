    <h1>Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO) — Long Recommendation</h1>

    <div class="image-container">
      <img src="nvo.jpg" alt="Novo Nordisk">

        <span>Phil Zhang</span>
        <span>May 5th 2024</span>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Thesis Statement</h2>
    <p>
      I recommend a long position in Novo Nordisk (NVO) with a multi-year horizon as (1) global obesity prevalence has reached structurally elevated levels, driving a sustained expansion in demand for GLP-1 therapies, and (2) Novo Nordisk's entrenched competitive advantages in insulin have translated into category leadership in obesity treatment through Ozempic and Wegovy. Strong pricing power, patent protection through 2031–2032, and capacity expansion support durable earnings growth and justify continued multiple support.
    </p>

    <h2>Business Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Novo Nordisk is a global pharmaceutical leader with deep expertise in chronic metabolic diseases, historically anchored in insulin and diabetes care. The company has successfully leveraged this foundation into the obesity treatment market through GLP-1 therapies, most notably Ozempic and Wegovy. Revenue is increasingly driven by diabetes and obesity medications, which together form the core of Novo Nordisk's growth engine.
    </p>

    <h2>Current Price & Setup</h2>
    <p>
      Novo Nordisk trades at $US123.05 (as of May 5th, 2024) with a target price of $US160.16, implying $US37.11 of upside per share over the investment horizon. Trailing and forward P/E multiples of 43.01x and 37.17x respectively support a conservative one-year valuation of $US142.38, with further upside driven by volume growth, operating leverage, and sustained demand for GLP-1 therapies.
    </p>

    <h2>Industry Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Obesity has become a critical global public health issue, with World Health Organization data showing global obesity rates have doubled since the 1990s. As of 2022, approximately 16% of the world's adult population is classified as obese. This structural shift has catalyzed a rapidly expanding market for therapeutic weight-loss interventions. The obesity treatment market is projected to grow by 60% by 2035, creating a long-duration growth runway for effective, scalable pharmaceutical solutions.
    </p>

    <h2>Competitive Landscape</h2>
    <p>
      Novo Nordisk commands approximately 55% market share in the obesity treatment market, supported by end-to-end capabilities spanning R&D, manufacturing, and distribution. Relative to peers such as Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk operates with superior profitability, generating 36.55% profit margins versus 17.08% for competitors. Patent protection for Ozempic and Wegovy through 2031 and 2032 in both the U.S. and Europe provides insulation from near-term generic competition.
    </p>

    <h2>Supporting Thesis Points</h2>

    <h3>1. Structural Demand Growth in Obesity & Diabetes Care</h3>
    <p>
      Sales of obesity care surged 154% to DKK 41.6bn in 2023, driven by strong adoption of Ozempic and Wegovy. Ozempic sales increased 42% to DKK 27.81bn, while Wegovy sales more than doubled to DKK 9.38bn. Combined diabetes and obesity sales rose 25% to DKK 61bn, contributing to total company sales growth of 22% to DKK 65.35bn.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Durable Competitive Moats and Capacity Expansion</h3>
    <p>
      Novo Nordisk's historical dominance in insulin has translated into deep operational moats across research, manufacturing, and distribution. The company is actively scaling capacity through a $6bn investment in new manufacturing facilities and the $11bn acquisition of Catalent, positioning it to meet sustained demand growth while reinforcing supply-side control.
    </p>

    <h2>Risks and Mitigants</h2>

    <h3>1. Competitive Pressure from Peer Innovation</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Accelerated innovation or capacity expansion from competitors could pressure pricing or market share.</li>
      <li><strong>Mitigant:</strong> Novo Nordisk's scale, patent protection, and superior margins provide meaningful insulation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Valuation Sensitivity</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Elevated trailing and forward P/E multiples may expose the stock to near-term multiple compression.</li>
      <li><strong>Mitigant:</strong> Structural demand growth, recurring revenue from chronic conditions, and expanding production capacity support earnings visibility and justify premium valuation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Catalysts & Event Path</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Continued growth in Ozempic and Wegovy prescription volumes</li>
      <li>Incremental capacity coming online from manufacturing expansion</li>
      <li>Sustained obesity and diabetes sales momentum in quarterly earnings</li>
      <li>Reinforcement of market leadership as patent protection remains intact through the early 2030s</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>ProShares UltraShort Euro (EUO) — Long Recommendation</h1>

    <div class="image-container">
      <img src="proshares.jpg" alt="ProShares UltraShort Euro">

        <span>May 5th 2024</span>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Thesis Statement</h2>
    <p>
      I recommend a long position in ProShares UltraShort Euro (EUO) with a 6-month horizon as (1) monetary policy divergence between the Eurozone and the U.S. is widening, with the ECB signaling earlier rate cuts while the Fed remains constrained by persistent inflation, and (2) relative yield differentials are likely to drive capital flows toward U.S. dollar assets, pressuring the euro. EUO provides a leveraged and efficient vehicle to express a bearish EUR/USD view.
    </p>

    <h2>Instrument Overview</h2>
    <p>
      ProShares UltraShort Euro (EUO) is a leveraged ETF designed to deliver twice the inverse of the daily performance of the euro relative to the U.S. dollar. The product is commonly used by macro hedge funds to express short-term directional views on EUR/USD driven by interest rate differentials, monetary policy expectations, and capital flow dynamics.
    </p>

    <h2>Current Price & Setup</h2>
    <p>
      EUO trades at $31.26 (as of May 5th, 2024) with a target price of $34.00, implying $2.74 of upside per share over a 6-month horizon. The trade is structured for a global macro hedge fund client and incorporates a disciplined risk framework given the leveraged nature of the instrument.
    </p>

    <h2>Macro & Policy Backdrop</h2>
    <p>
      Post-pandemic economic recoveries between the Eurozone and the U.S. have diverged. While Europe has made greater progress returning inflation toward its 2% target, U.S. inflation has re-accelerated from 3.2% to 3.5% (March 2024). Public commentary from ECB President Christine Lagarde and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reinforces this divergence, with the ECB increasingly open to monetary easing while the Fed maintains a restrictive stance amid persistent inflation pressures.
    </p>

    <h2>Relative Value & Transmission Mechanism</h2>
    <p>
      When the ECB cuts rates ahead of the Fed, yields on euro-denominated assets decline relative to U.S. assets. This reduces the attractiveness of holding euros, prompting capital reallocation toward higher-yielding dollar assets. The resulting decline in euro demand and strengthening of the dollar directly supports EUO's inverse exposure to EUR/USD. As capital flows shift toward the U.S., the dollar's yield advantage and perceived stability reinforce further appreciation.
    </p>

    <h2>Supporting Thesis Points</h2>

    <h3>1. Policy Divergence Drives Yield Differentials</h3>
    <p>
      The ECB's openness to near-term easing contrasts with the Fed's decision on May 1, 2024, to maintain current interest rate targets. This asymmetric policy outlook widens interest rate differentials in favor of the U.S., a historically reliable driver of EUR/USD depreciation.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Efficient Expression via Leveraged Structure</h3>
    <p>
      EUO provides a direct and capital-efficient way to capture downside in the euro, amplifying returns through its 2x inverse exposure. This structure is well suited to a defined, short-to-medium-term macro view aligned with central bank signaling.
    </p>

    <h2>Risks and Mitigants</h2>

    <h3>1. Leveraged ETF Decay and Volatility</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Daily rebalancing can lead to decay and compounding losses during periods of high volatility or sideways markets.</li>
      <li><strong>Mitigant:</strong> The trade is time-bound (6 months) and paired with an explicit stop-loss to manage downside risk.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Policy Reversal or Data Shock</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Unexpected U.S. disinflation or delayed ECB easing could compress rate differentials.</li>
      <li><strong>Mitigant:</strong> Ongoing monitoring of inflation prints and central bank communication allows for timely reassessment.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Risk Management Framework</h2>
    <p>
      Given EUO's leveraged profile and typical EUR/USD volatility, a 2.5% stop-loss is applied to balance protection against adverse moves while allowing for normal market fluctuations. Based on the entry price of $31.26, the stop-loss is set at $30.47.
    </p>

    <h2>Catalysts & Event Path</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>ECB rate cut signaling or implementation</li>
      <li>Fed reaffirmation of higher-for-longer policy stance</li>
      <li>Eurozone inflation and growth data weakening relative to the U.S.</li>
      <li>Capital flow shifts toward higher-yielding U.S. assets reflected in FX markets</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      A long position in EUO with a $34 target price and $30.47 stop-loss is recommended to capture expected euro depreciation driven by monetary policy divergence between the ECB and the Federal Reserve.
