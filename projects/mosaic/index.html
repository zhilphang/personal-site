    <h1>The Mosaic Company (NYSE: MOS) – Long Recommendation</h1>

    </div>

    <h2>Thesis Statement</h2>
    <p>
      I recommend a long position in MOS with a 12-month horizon as (1) the street is over-discounting temporary tariff/stockpiling effects that suppress near-term pricing, and (2) geopolitical risk and strategic reserve behavior will keep fungible supply tight, setting up a pricing/volume rebound into 2026. Mosaic's concentrated exposure to potash/phosphate gives higher beta to recovery versus diversified peers. Dividend (~2.5%) and buybacks provide carry while we wait.
    </p>

    <h2>Business Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Mosaic is the largest U.S. producer of potash and phosphate crop nutrients, operating integrated mining, processing, and distribution networks across North and South America. Revenue is primarily generated from U.S. in ~36% of sales and phosphate sales internationally.
    </p>

    <h2>Current Price & Setup</h2>
    <p>
      MOS trades at $24.92 (as of Nov 6th 2025) with a $36 target (~44.46% upside over 12 months). Recent earnings have been pressured by lower realized pricing, though volumes are stabilizing. Markets expect normalized EBITDA of ~$2.5B as of 1Q25, revenue has declined normalization to continue into 2026 given the supply/price setup. MOS trades around ~10x forward P/E, a discount to the direct comparable (~12.5x), and has a strong balance sheet with a net D/E ratio of ~25%.
    </p>

    <h2>Industry Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Fertilizer is non-discretionary; it underpins crop yields and global food security. The Russia–Ukraine war highlighted how quickly fertilizer markets can seize up; with Belarusian/Russian potash curtailed, government/importers stockpiled as a strategic reserve, amplifying geopolitical risks (Russia–Ukraine, China–Taiwan; Middle East), large importers (Brazil, India, China) have incentives to prioritize reliability and self-sufficiency, which tightens tradable supply and amplifies price swings. In this context, assets in stable jurisdictions (U.S.) carry premium strategic value.
    </p>

    <h2>Competitive Landscape</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Mosaic vs. Nutrien (NTR):</em> NTR is diversified (retail, nitrogen, potash) and thus has lower earnings beta. MOS is more concentrated in phosphate/potash—higher operating leverage.</li>
      <li><em>U.S. footprint:</em> If tariffs keep imported supply (e.g., Canadian potash) structurally pricier, Mosaic's U.S. production benefits on relative economics.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Supporting Thesis Points</h2>

    <h3>1. Tariffs & Inventories Drive Dec–Jan. Softness, 2H Rebound</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Recent tariffs prompted buyers to front-load purchases and build inventories, depressing spot prices and sentiment.</li>
      <li>4Q-2025 dynamics point to overhang: distributors loaded, carrying costs, lifting realized prices even without a demand surge.</li>
      <li>Because Mosaic is more potash/phosphate-centric, it has higher upside beta to the pricing recovery than diversified peers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Geopolitical Risk Sustains Strategic Reserve Behavior</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Strategic stockpiles remove supply from the open market, reducing fungibility and magnifying price elasticity.</li>
      <li>With assets in geopolitically stable jurisdictions (U.S., Brazil), Mosaic becomes a preferred counterparty for sovereigns and large importers seeking reliability.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Risks and Mitigants</h2>

    <h3>1. Potash Price Volatility / Tariff Rollback</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Risk:</strong> A faster-than-expected decline in tariffs or weaker global demand (Brazil/India/China) could prolong price normalization.</li>
      <li><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Mosaic has shown pricing discipline (PLI/Fertilizer constraints), supportive policy position and U.S./Brazil asset base cushion margins.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Peer over-nationalization (NTR) offers downside protection</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Risk:</strong> In a continued low-price/low-inflation/low interest rate scenario, NTR's lower earnings volatility relative to MOS.</li>
      <li><strong>Mitigation:</strong> If pricing normalizes, MOS's higher beta will pay, but in a persistently weak macro/pricing environment, lower beta can pair with NTR.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Catalysts & Event Path</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Inventory Drawdown (2025):</strong> Evidence of dealer/sovereign restocking at tariff-inclusive prices.</li>
      <li><strong>China/India Tender Awards:</strong> Large import volumes signaling sustained demand and tighter global balances.</li>
      <li><strong>Tariff Clarity:</strong> U.S./Canada trade policy stabilization or exemptions that support MOS's cost position.</li>
      <li><strong>Earnings Inflection (1H 2026):</strong> Normalized margins and volume recovery reflected in results, driving re-rating.</li>
    </ul>
